My Minecraft Hardcore World

Minecraft Version: 1.14.4 (Use OptiFine for best performance)

How to navigate this repo?
There are three folders which contain the save (zipped) file of the world,
at three different points (timeline) in the world.
1. pre_fight: contains the save file at home base before the Ender Dragon fight
2. right_before_right: contains the save file right at the End portal i.e right before the fight (if you want to fight the Dragon with my gear).
3. post_fight: contains the save file after the Ender Dragon fight, back at home base

Some useful coordinates:
Home Base: near 0 ~ 0
Nether Portal (Overworld): 0 ~ 0
Nether Portal (Nether): -12 47 -2
Staircase to End Portal: -711 78 1255
End Portal: -760 34 1254
