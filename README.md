My Minecraft Hardcore World  
Minecraft Version: 1.14.4 (Use OptiFine for best performance)

There are four folders which contain the save (zipped) file of the world,
at four different points (timeline) in the world.
1. pre_fight: contains the save file at home base before the Ender Dragon fight
2. right_before_right: contains the save file right at the End portal i.e right before the fight (if you want to fight the Dragon with my gear).
3. post_fight: contains the save file after the Ender Dragon fight, back at home base
4. post_game: contains the save file after achieving most of the major accomplishments available in the game, and this is also where I stopped playing
   in this world (save file).

Some useful coordinates:

Home Base: near 0 ~ 0  
Nether Portal (Overworld): 0 ~ 0  
Nether Portal (Nether): -12 47 -2  
Staircase to End Portal: -711 78 1255  
End Portal: -760 34 1254
